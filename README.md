# Necroware's NW12887 RTC module

This is a drop-in replacement for RTC modules with solid body. Such modules were
widely used on 486 and Pentium mainboards back in the days. After so many years
the battery inside of such modules got empty and there is no way to exchange it.
With empty battery BIOS settings can not be saved and so many mainboards can't
even boot properly. This alternative solution has a socket for CR1225 and the
battery can be easily replaced again, when it gets empty.
